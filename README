*** Release notes ***

Version 0.6.0 (27th August 2013)

- Important: Harmonised file encodings: you may need to rebuild your BWT files or just convert bwt-B00 from BWT_ASCII to BWT_RLE with beetl-convert (bwt-B00 was always ASCII-encoded. It now follows the same encoding as the other piles)
- Now requires GCC with C++11 support (gcc 4.3 or above)
- New Markdown documentation style
- Faster beetl-compare and metaBEETL
- Lossless quality compression scripts added, even though they are not using BWT
- New features:
  - BWT creation with reverse-complemented reads (--add-rev-comp)
  - BWT creation with multiple reads per sequence (--sequence-length)
- Support for BCL and BCL.gz in beetl-convert


Version 0.5.0 (10th June 2013)

- Faster metaBEETL
  - Pruning of BKPT to reduce the number of MTAXA tests and output lines
  - New beetl-compare --subset obtion for distributed computing


Version 0.4.0 (10th April 2013)

- Robustness improvements


Version 0.3.0 (7th April 2013)

- Metagenomics 'META-BEETL' code added to main tree


Version 0.2.0 (19th March 2013)

- Longest Common Prefix computation integrated under --generate-lcp in beetl-bwt
- New beetl-unbwt command line interface


Version 0.1.0 (28th February 2013)

- New command line interface
- Support for FASTA, FASTQ, raw SEQ and cycle-by-cycle files as input
- Distinct intermediate and final formats
- Support for Huffman encoding as intermediate or final format
- Support for intermediate "incremental run-length-encoded" format
- Automatic detection of format
- Performance prediction for automatic use of fastest algorithm and options


Version 0.0.2 (25th June 2012)


Version 0.0.1 (18th November 2011)

This contains initial implementations of the BCR and BCRext algorithms
as described in our CPM paper.
