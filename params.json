{"name":"Beetl","body":"# BEETL: Burrows-Wheeler Extended Tool Library\r\n\r\nBEETL is a suite of applications for building and manipulating the \r\nBurrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) of collections of DNA sequences. \r\nThe algorithms employed in BEETL are intended to scale to collections of \r\nsequences containing one billion entries or more.\r\n\r\nThe initial release implements two flavours of an algorithm for\r\nbuilding the BWT of a sequence collection - BCR and BCRext.\r\n\r\nSubsequent releases will add functionality for efficient inversion and\r\nquerying of BWTs.\r\n\r\nQuestions and queries can be sent to the BEETL [mailing list] (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/BEETL/)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* Markus J.
